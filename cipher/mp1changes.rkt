Changes In Turning In:
1) Before I forgot to actually turn in the entire project to gradescope, so now I have.


Changes to Code:
2) In all 3 of my classes I had style-check errors,s I went in and corrected those to the best of my ability. I also added a header to all three of my files, instead of just Cipher.java

AllCaesar.java:  indentation, trailing spaces, missing Javadoc comments
Cipher.java: fixing indentation, trailing spaces, missing Javadoc comments, and variable naming inconsistencies.
CipherUtils.java: indentation, removing trailing spaces, replacing magic numbers with constants (Replaced the literal 26 with a constant ALPHABET_SIZE.), and fixing code structure.

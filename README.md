CITATIONS https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compare-two-strings-in-java/ & https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-matches-method-in-java-with-examples/ & https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_regex.asp; gave me an understanding of how to compare strings in java https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3163399/difference-between-system-out-println-and-system-err-println; gave me a rundown on different error messages and when to use which Our CS Mentor Maria sent out an email using a code snippet I used for this project to avoid the magic numbers error: "No magic numbers! If you want to check argc to be == 4 (or something like that) code the following within your class but outside of your main private static final int EXPECTED_NUM_PARAMS = 4" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtAeP7VGplA; gave me a better understanding of using args as a parameter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRd_Yb9Ujw; taught me how to use shift in Java and gave me a good basis of how to set up my method in the utilities. https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_string_startswith.asp; helped me come up with a method to check which arguments are being inputted, so I can accordingly output. I also looked back on the cipher mini-project that we did in 161, since that also used a Caesar cipher. I don't remember the name of the CS tutor, but one of them helped me with Maven issues I was having to get it to compile. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/java-operator-and-or-logical-operators/; helped me write if statements using operators in Java https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-ternary-operator-with-examples/; taught me how to use ternary operators in Java, used this to make some methods less lines of code instead of if statements.
